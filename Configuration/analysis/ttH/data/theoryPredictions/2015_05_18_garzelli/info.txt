Updated results of the analysis (with higher statistics, after running the whole week), for the two system of cuts (2.1) and (1.1) and the various distributions.
The scale is chosen as mur=muf=Ht/4

The distributions and total sigma after cuts change a little bit with respect to the past. The cross-sections are now (the error is just statistical error):
  cuts 2.1:  2.08e-2 ± 0.06e-2 pb
  cuts 1.1:  6.17e-2 ± 0.13e-2 pb

On top of these cross-sections, one has to add error due to scale variation: my (not so high statistics) runs give something like +38% - 28%  when considering the range [Ht/8 - Ht/2].


Definition of the cuts:
1.1 tt+bb - full phase space
2.1 tt+bb - visible phase space
